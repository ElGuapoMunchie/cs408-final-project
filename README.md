# Web Dev Final Project

## Project Spec

### General Theme
This project represents a complete website, that in an alternate universe, might have been used by
lawyer Saul Goodman (from Breaking Bad). It will be a combo photo gallery and user interface for users to learn more about the lawyer. Unlike the hokey lawyer, this will meet the best of ethical standards and will be an honest attempt to create a "coorporate" looking website that a practicing lawyer might use while on the job. 

### What it will do
There are 5 webpages that will be accessible on the site, each of them are detailed below:

1. **Landing Page**: The landing page will be the page viewers initially land on when they open up the website. It will include a menu bar across the top with links to each page, and a large centered text column containing pictures and an 'ad' for Saul's business.

2. **Forum**: The forum will maintain the same general layout with the menu bar and center column, but will instead contain a scrollable window where the user can browse reviews and conversations about Saul and his services. On the side of the page, there will be buttons allowing a viewer to create a new post. The backend of this forum will be powered using AWS and the backend that we've developed in our labs.

3. **Notable Cases**: This webpage will have a two column layout that shows embedded videos and text testimonials of notable cases that Saul Goodman has worked on.

4. **About BCS**: This page serves as an "About Me" section, which will detail information about Saul, such as his education, where he comes from, and how long he's been practicing for

5. **Contact**: This last webpage will show contact details for users to get in contact with Mr. Goodman.

### Target Audience
The target audience is the general public, or individuals interested in acquiring Mr. Goodman's services. 

### Stretch Goals
As a stretch goal, I would like to make the `contact` page contain either a form from which users can send emails to Mr. Goodman regarding their cases, or create a booking system in which users can select a date and time to meet with Mr. Goodman.
